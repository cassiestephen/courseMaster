# courseMaster
CourseMaster is a SwiftUI application, with a goal of generating courses for horseback riders to use. 
As thinking up a course can be a tedious task, CourseMaster allows the user to input a desired number of single jumps and oxers. 
A course is then outputted, with reccomended distances for various horse sizes.


Currently, CourseMaster only supports courses in standard rectangular arenas and only generates courses with up to 8 jumps and 4 oxers.
Small pony, medium pony and horse are the only horse sizes available.

# Platforms
Currently, CourseMaster runs only on iPhone devices
